# Breast-cancer-prediction-application-using-Machine-Learning

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. (Only lung cancer kills more women each year.) The chance that a woman will die from breast cancer is about 1 in 39 (about 2.5%).
Breast cancer death rates have been decreasing steadily since 1989, for an overall decline of 43% through 2020. The decrease in death rates is believed to be the result of finding breast cancer earlier through screening and increased awareness, as well as better treatments. However, the decline has slowed slightly in recent years.
<p>For this reason I am conducting this project to be able to predict the early onset of breast cancer and whether it is malignant or benign.</p>
<p>The project portfolio will not solve curing phase of cancer rather early onset prediction and predetermination of cancer.</p></br>
<p>The project portfolio will help women particularly as they are the target pool that are highly at risk for breast cancer</p>.</br>
This project is relevant for a worldwide use for all women to benefit from.


Machine learning is widely used in bio informatics and particularly in breast cancer diagnosis.
In this project, we have used certain classification methods such as K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) which is a supervised learning method to detect breast cancer. 
Cancer diagnosis is one of the most studied problems in the medical domain.
Several researchers have focused in order to improve performance and achieved to obtain satisfactory results.
Early detection of cancer is essential for a rapid response and better chances of cure. 
Unfortunately, early detection of cancer is often difﬁcult because the symptoms of the disease at the beginning are absent.
Thus, it is necessary to discover and interpret new knowledge to prevent and minimize the risk adverse consequences.


To understand this problem more precisely, tools are needed to help oncologists to choose
the treatment required for healing or prevention of recurrence by reducing the harmful effects of certain treatments and their costs. 
In artiﬁcial intelligent, machine learning is a discipline which allows the machine to evolve through a process.
Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset obtained by the university of Wisconsin Hospital is used to classify tumors as benign or malignant.

#k- Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) classification technique:


k-NN is a non- parametric method used for classification. In this classification, the output is a class membership.
An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors,
with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). 
If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor. It is the simplest algorithm among all the machine learning algorithms.

#Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification Technique:


Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both  classification or regression challenges. However, it is mostly used in classification problems. In this algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiate the two classes very well
